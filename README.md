# GeoGuessr Agent

## What Is GeoGeussr
> [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) is a geography game which takes you on a journey around the world and challenges your ability to recognize your surroundings. Your user character is placed on a designated place somewhere in the world and your mission is to figure out, based on your surroundings, where your user character is situated.

## How to Use Our Application
- Run `application/agent.py`
- Wait for couple of seconds, it will automatically screenshot your screen. Enter `y` in terminal if there's no problem.
- Pressing `e` so the agent will do a screenshot on your screen, and automatically predict the country based on the image.
- After several screenshots you have done in a single round, press `t` so that the agent will do a summary for you, and you can click the predicted answer that told by our agent.
